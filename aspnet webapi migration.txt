changed all references and updated usings
formatters
	changed sync methods to async methods (e.g. OnWriteToStream -> OnWriteToStreamAsyc) and modified to use tasks
	++ was able to delete the WriteXx method when it is not used
	-- the formatter api is still crazy ugly
		method signature is really long
		i don't have a good sense of what happens if i don't just return a new task by default (e.g. what happens if i call base.OnXxX?)
message handlers
	++ hurray!  these haven't changed
